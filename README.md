The Snake Game is a classic arcade game that has been enjoyed by generations of players. The objective of the game is to control a snake and help it eat as many food items as possible without crashing into walls or its own body. The game is simple to understand, but challenging to master, and requires quick reflexes and strategic thinking.

The Snake Game user interface is a web-based implementation of this classic game using HTML, CSS, and pure JavaScript. The game interface consists of a playing area with a snake and food items. The player can control the snake using the arrow keys on their keyboard. As the snake eats more food items, its length increases, making the game more challenging. If the snake touches the border of the playing area or its own body, the game ends, and a popup appears with an option to play again.

The Snake Game is an excellent example of a simple yet entertaining game created using web technologies. The game's implementation is a testament to the versatility of web development and showcases the power of pure JavaScript. The game is a great way to kill time and improve hand-eye coordination, making it an excellent choice for gamers of all ages.
